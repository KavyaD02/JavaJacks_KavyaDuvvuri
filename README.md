## River Water Purity Observation and Analysis

It is very important to know the purity level of the water present in a river at different places along the course of a river. We shall use certain parameters like temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH value, biological oxygen demand (BOD), conductivity, nitrate_N_nitrite_N content, and fecal content of water at different places and show the purity observations, throught GUI. Also, suggestions to improve the water quality are given.
